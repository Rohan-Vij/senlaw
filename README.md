### Problem
In the age of information, seniors have been left behind in many aspects due to their incapability to quickly adapt to new technologies year on year as younger generations have done. Some aspects of the internet which they do not have access to are minor and relatively low-impact: video games, surveys, and the such. However, there are some key parts of living in the 21st century that have been put online, such as financial resources (bank apps/websites) or legal help. Without access to these vital services, senior citizens become vulnerable and targeted in the digital world. Our team decided to focus on the latter due to the decentralized nature of the legal system - we cannot change the user interface of large banks, but we can make our own application to connect users to law firms.
